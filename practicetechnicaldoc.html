                      <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.

                     </p>

                     <strong>Online Playgrounds</strong>

                     <p>If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on CodePen, CodeSandbox, or Stackblitz.

                     If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/main/static/html/single-file-example.html">download this HTML file</a>, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos.

                      </p>

                    <p><strong>Add React In A Minute</strong><br>In this section, we will show how to add a React component to an existing HTML page. You can follow along with your own website, or create an empty HTML file to practice.

                     There will be no complicated tools or install requirements — to complete this section, you only need an internet connection, and a minute of your time</p>

                  <strong>Step 1: Add a DOM Container to the HTML</strong>

                 <p>First, open the HTML page you want to edit. Add an empty <div> tag to mark the spot where you want to display something with React. For example:</p>

                    <code>
                        <!-- ... existing HTML ... -->

                                     <div id="like_button_container"></div>
            
                                         <!-- ... existing HTML ... -->
                    </code>

                 <p>We gave this <div> a unique id HTML attribute. This will allow us to find it from the JavaScript code later and display a React component inside of it.</p>

                <strong>Step 2: Add The script Tag</strong>   <br>

                <p>Next, add three script tags to the HTML page right before the closing body tag</p>
                
            
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                        .. other HTML ...
                         Load React.
                        Note: when deploying, replace "development.js" with "production.min.js".

                        {script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin>script
                        script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin> script}

                        Load our React component.

                        script src="like_button.js">script

                       </body>
                  </code>
                </pre>
                      <strong>Step 3: Create React Component </strong>
                      <p>Create a file called like_button.js next to your HTML page.Open<a href="Open this starter code and paste it into the file you created.">this starter code and paste it into the file you created.    </a> </p>
                        <p>After the starter code, add two lines to the bottom of like_button.js:</p>
                        <pre><code>
                        // ... the starter code you pasted ...

                        const domContainer = document.querySelector('#like_button_container');
                        
                        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(domContainer);
                        root.render(e(LikeButton));</code></pre>
                        <p>These three lines of code find the <div> we added to our HTML in the first step, create a React app with it, and then display our “Like” button React component inside of it.

                        </p>
                        <strong>Thats It</strong>
                     <p>There is no step four. You have just added the first React component to your website.</p>

                    <header>Try React with JSX</header>
                    <p>In the examples above, we only relied on features that are natively supported by browsers. This is why we used a JavaScript function call to tell React what to display:</p>

                    <pre class="line-numbers">
                        <code class="language-markup">
                            //"  const e = React.createElement;

                            // Display a "Like" button


                                </code>
                                </pre>
                         <pre><code>      
                              //return e(
                                'button',
                            { onClick: () => this.setState({ liked: true }) },
                                 'Like'
                               );"
                        </code>
                        </pre>
                    
                     
                    
                         <p>However, React also offers an option to use <a href=""https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX instead:</a>
                        </p>
                       <pre> <code>
                            {// Display a "Like" button
                            return (
                                button onClick={() => this.setState({ liked: true })}>
                                Like
                                /button
                            );}
                        </code> 
                    </pre>
                            <p>These two code snippets are equivalent. While JSX is <a href="       You can play with JSX using this online converter">completely optional</a>, many people find it helpful for writing UI code — both with React and with other libraries.
                                </p>
